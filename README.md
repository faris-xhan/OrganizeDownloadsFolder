# OrganizeDownloadsFolder

I made this script that will organize your download files according to their type :)
It is a really simple script anyone with a bit of python knowledge can edit this script according to their knowledge.

## Features

- Files with extension of `'doc', 'xls', 'pdf', 'docx' or 'txt'` would move to `Documents` folder

- Files with extension of `'jpeg', 'jpg', 'png' or 'gif'` would move to `Pictures` folder

- Files with extension of `'mkv', 'avi', 'mp4' or 'ts'` would move to `Videos` folder

- Files with extension of `'zip', 'rar' or '7z'` would move to `Compressed` folder

- Files with extension of `'exe', 'bat' or 'msi'` would move to `Programs` folder

- Files with extension of `'mp3' or 'wav'` would move to `Music` folder

- All the others file would be moved to `Others` folder.
